## 💡 How It Works

### Fetching Images

The app calls the API:

```
https://randomfox.ca/floof/
```

Each response provides a new fox image URL, which is pushed into an array and rendered into the masonry grid.


### Modal Preview

Clicking any image opens it fullscreen, with navigation buttons and keyboard support.
